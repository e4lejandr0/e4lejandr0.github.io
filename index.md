## Blog setup!

Thanks to the software portability class I have gotten
around to develop my Github Pages website during this term.

I will be posting regular updates on the progress of the class and
topics covered therein.

### Projects Based

This will be a project based course which I am really looking forward to.
We will be directly working with Open Source tecnologies and contributing
directly with upstream when possible.
